Title:Nikola Tesla
Description:Nikola Tesla Jul 10 1856Jan 7 1943 was a prolific inventor and visionary pioneer of physics chemistry and electrical and mechanical engineering There is no doubt that with the enormous potentials obtainable by the use of high frequencies and oil insulation luminous discharges might be passed through many miles of rarefied air and that by thus directing the energy of many hundreds or thousands of horsepower motors or lamps might be operated at considerable distances from stationary sources But such schemes are mentioned merely as possibilities We shall have no need to transmit power at all Ere many generations pass our machinery will be driven by a power obtainable at any point of the universe This idea is not novel Men have been led to it long ago by instinct or reason it has been expressed in many ways and in many places in the history of old and new We find it in the delightful myth of Antheus who derives power from the earth we find it among the subtle speculations of one of your splendid mathematicians and in many hints and statements of thinkers of the present time Throughout space there is energy Is this energy static or kinetic If static our hopes are in vain if kineticand this we know it is for certainthen it is a mere question of time when men will succeed in attaching their machinery to the very wheelwork of nature Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency London 1892 Nikola Tesla My Inventions The autobiography of Nikola Tesla 1919 Arthur J Beckhard Nikola Tesla Electrical Genius 1959 See wikirNikolaTeslawiki for more information sources collected notes",0

the current standards of ethics in the media have alienated the artists developers and creators who perpetuate the things we love enjoy and enthusiastically build communities around We have observed numerous incidents involving conflicts of interest and agendapushing within media which we feel are damaging to the credibility of the medium and harm the community at large We believe much of the current media is complicit in the proliferation of an ideology that squashes individuality divides along political lines and is stifling to the freedom of creativity that is the foundation of human expression KotakuInAction is a community that condemns willful censorship exclusion harassment and abuse It is a community that organizes to hold the media accountable to the concept of artistic freedom by standing up for the artist the developer the writer the filmmaker and all who enjoy the freedom to create explore and expand It is a community that allows the exchange of information supports the ongoing discussion of media ethics and protects the right of the individual to embrace their personal interests in entertainment and fandom KotakuInAction is built around a core focus on reasonable friendly discussion of the issues related to gaming culture and those involved in it That is not all we are about but its where we began and will remain our core We hold ourselves to be
